The Gallery showcases photos of projects that have been completed by Gal with a Trowel, and Contact provides users with several ways to contact the business.

Code Louisville Project Requirements:

2 media queries:
The base styles are mobile-first design, made to look good on small screens like smartphones. There are two main media queries, the first is for a min-width of 500px which changes the navigation menu at the top to display horizontally instead of vertically. The second media query is for large screens (min-width 1000px) which displays the About, Services, and Gallery sections in columns. There is an additional media query only to adjust the images for in-between screen sizes.

2 CSS Features
The top navigation menu switches between vertical and horizontal layouts when switching between mobile and desktop/landscape tablets (1). The About, Services, and Gallery sections all use Flexbox to change their layout into two columns for largeer screen sizes (2).

2 JavaScript Features (2)
I created a JavaScript array of photos (1), then used a function employing Math.random and Math.floor calculations (2) to randomly display a photo in the header below the top navigation links.
